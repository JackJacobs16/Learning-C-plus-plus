# LearningC-
At the time of writing, I have been learning C++ for approximately one month, mostly by watching the educational series on YouTube by Kenny Yip (link in the README). Whilst learning the syntax and how one writes C++ can be done by watching and reading, it is important to complete your own projects. Hence the creating of this repository.
